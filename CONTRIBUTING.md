# 🌟 Hacktoberfest 2024 Contribution Guide for HHG-ERP 🏥

Welcome to the **HHG-ERP** repository! We're excited to have you join us in making a difference with this project. **HHG-ERP** is an ERP web application built to streamline and digitize operations for a client in the agricultural sector. The app replaces manual book-keeping with an automated system that tracks daily entries, cash flow, and the status of produce as it moves from farmers to markets. Built with Next.js and PostgreSQL, it provides features like receipt generation, inventory tracking, and vendor management. By leveraging local data caching and automated notifications through WhatsApp, the app optimizes performance and enhances transparency, making it easier to manage transactions and reduce human errors in the process. This guide will help you set up the project, make valuable contributions, and participate in **Hacktoberfest 2024**. Let's get started! 🌐💻
